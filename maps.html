        In today's fast-paced world, navigation apps have become an essential
        tool for millions of users worldwide. However, the usability of modern
        navigation apps for both iOS and Android platforms has been a
        significant concern due to their complex and inconsistent user interface
        (UI) and an unpleasant user experience (UX). This case study delves into
        the pain points faced by users and proposes a new UI approach to enhance
        the usability of maps applications.

      <h2 class="title">Current Situation</h2>
      <p>
        Google Maps is a leading provider of digital mapping services available
        in over 220 countries and territories. It offers accurate, real-time
        directions and information about businesses and attractions, making it
        one of the most widely used mapping applications globally, with over 1
        billion monthly active users. Google Maps provides turn-by-turn
        navigation, live traffic updates, and local business information to help
        people get around conveniently. Its goal is to simplify exploration and
        navigation worldwide, making it easier for users to discover new places,
        plan trips, and access information. <br />Now overloaded app with
        distractions and unnecessary information, resulting in a cluttered
        interface and frustrating user experience:
      </p>
      <li>
        <img class="icon" src="./img/Bad.png" />
        <p>
          Complex and Inconsistent UI: The lack of a standardized UI across
          navigation apps confuses users who switch between different platforms.
          This inconsistency hampers the overall user experience and increases
          the learning curve.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <img class="icon" src="./img/Bad.png" />
        <p>
          Distractions and Unnecessary Information: Overloading the app with
          irrelevant information, such as excessive icons, buttons, and data,
          distracts users from their primary task of finding directions.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <img class="icon" src="./img/Bad.png" />
        <p>
          Too Many Functionalities: While navigation apps offer various
          features, presenting all functionalities simultaneously can be
          overwhelming. Users may struggle to identify and access the features
          they need urgently, leading to suboptimal user experience.

      <h3 class="title">Proposed Solution</h3>
      <p>
        To overcome the existing challenges and enhance maps app usability, a
        new UI approach is needed. The following strategies are recommended:
      </p>
      <li>
        <img class="icon" src="./img/It.png" />
        <p>
          Streamlined and Consistent UI Design will improve user familiarity and
          ease of use. Implementing common UI components, intuitive icons, and
          standardized navigation patterns will create a seamless experience for
          users
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <img class="icon" src="./img/It.png" />
        <p>
          User-Centric Information Display: Reducing distractions and displaying
          only essential information based on the user's context and preferences
          will make the app more user-centric. Implementing smart filters and
          personalized settings will ensure users receive the most relevant
          information.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <img class="icon" src="./img/It.png" />
        <p>
          Progressive Functionality Disclosure: Instead of overwhelming users
          with all functionalities upfront, implement a progressive disclosure
          approach. This involves revealing features gradually as users explore
          the app, allowing them to learn and adapt to the app's capabilities at
          their own pace.

              The navigation UI should be as simple as possible. The less time
              the user spends understanding its functionality, the better. Here,
              the rule "less is more" applies.

            OpenStreetMaps allows customization of display settings. Here, only
            roads suitable for your vehicle are shown. Three route options are
            suggested:
